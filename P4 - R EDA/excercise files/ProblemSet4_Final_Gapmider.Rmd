## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(xlsx)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)

install.packages("xlsx")

R.version 

Sys.setenv(JAVA_HOME='C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre1.8.0_121')

getwd()

unemp <- read.xlsx('Unemployment.xlsx',1)

View(unemp)

names(unemp)

unemp <- gather(unemp,"years","unemployment_rate",2:26)

unemp <- subset(unemp,!is.na(unemp$unemployment_rate))

names(unemp)[names(unemp) == 'Total.15.24.unemployment....'] <- "country"

names(unemp)[names(unemp) == 'Total.15.24.unemployment....'] <- "country"

by(unemp$unemployment_rate,unemp$years,summary)

ggplot(data=unemp,aes(country,unemployment_rate),fill=unemp$country)+
  geom_boxplot(color='blue')+
  scale_x_discrete()
 

qplot(x = unemployment_rate, data = unemp, 
xlab = "Unemployment Rate",
ylab = "Count of Unemployment Rate by Year (1981-2005)", 
color = years) + 
facet_wrap(~country)


```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
