## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
```{r}
summary(mtcars)
```
```{r}
efficient <- subset(mtcars, mpg >= 23)
efficient
dim(efficient)
```
than 30 miles per gallon (mpg) and have more than 100 raw horsepower.
```{r}
subset(mtcars, mpg > 30 & hp > 100)
```
```{r}
subset(mtcars, mpg < 14 | disp > 390)
```

```{r}
subset(mtcars, qsec <= 16.9)
```

```{r}
lightcars <- subset(mtcars, wt <2)
lightcars
```

```{r}
mtcars$year <- 1974
head(mtcars)
```
```{r}
mtcars <- subset(mtcars, select = -year)
```
```{r}
mtcars$year <- c(1973, 1974)
(mtcars)
```
```{r}
mtcars <- subset(mtcars, select = -year) 
```
```{r}
mtcars$wt
cond <- mtcars$wt < 3
cond
mtcars$weight_class <- ifelse(cond, 'light', 'average')
mtcars$weight_class
cond <- mtcars$wt > 3.5
mtcars$weight_class <- ifelse(cond, 'heavy', mtcars$weight_class)
mtcars$weight_class
```
```{r}
rm(cond)
rm(efficient)
```
```{r}
subset(mtcars, mpg >=30 | hp < 60)
```
